# Portable EE Workbench
This project attempts to design and implement a portable, basic EE workbench and contains the following features:
<ul>
  <li>DC Voltmeter should have a range of 0 to 1000V.
  <li>DC Ammeter should have a range of 0 to 500mA.
  <li>Ohmmeter should have a range of 1 to 1MΩ.
  <li>Function Generator will produce three waveforms: sinusoidal, square, and triangular waves. The amplitude of the wave will be fixed at +5V peak to peak. The range of frequencies will be as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Square Wave Generator - 1Hz to 10kHz.
      <li> Triangular Wave Generator - 400Hz to 1200Hz.
      <li> Sinusoidal Wave Generator - 800Hz to 1500Hz.     
    </ul>
  <li>Oscilloscope will be able to display voltage range from +10V to -10V. The maximum frequency of the oscilloscope will depend on the smartphone as well as the microcontroller board and is therefore yet to be decided.
  <li>The display of all the measured values, including the waveforms will be performed on the android smartphone which will be in serial communication with the microcontroller using a USB OTG cable.
</ul>
